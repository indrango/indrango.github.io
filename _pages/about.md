Currently, I work as Product Manager at [Nodeflux](https://www.nodeflux.io/) where I handle a product for retail industry called [Retailmatix](https://retailmatix.com/). I'm responsible for ensuring that every AI solution created provides real value to the user.

I started my career as an AI Engineer with the scope of building AI vision solutions in the smart city industry. After two years, I was entrusted to lead the Dataset Management team to build a new division in charge of handling dataset creation operations.

Outside of work, I actively contribute as Head of Knowledge Management in the [Data Science Indonesia](https://datascience.or.id/) community, a non-profit organization that aims to create a data-based ecosystem to improve people's welfare. I lead several programs that ensure any knowledge about data can be properly distributed throughout Indonesian society.

This blog discusses my thoughts and experiences with product management and AI. Hopefully what I share can give you a little perspective on what you're looking for.
