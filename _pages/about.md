Currently, I work as Product Manager at [Nodeflux](https://www.nodeflux.io/) where I handle a product for retail industry called [Retailmatix](https://retailmatix.com/) and internal platform product. I'm responsible for ensuring that every AI solution created provides real value to the user.

I started my career as an AI Engineer with the scope of building computer vision solutions in the smart city industry. After two years, I was entrusted to lead the Dataset Management team to build a new division in charge of handling dataset annotation operations.

Outside of work, I actively contribute as Head of Knowledge Management in the [Data Science Indonesia](https://datascience.or.id/) community, a non-profit organization that aims to create a data-based ecosystem to improve people's welfare. I lead several programs that ensure any knowledge about data can be properly distributed throughout Indonesian society.

This blog discusses my thoughts and experiences with startup, product development and AI. Hopefully what I share can give you a little perspective on what you're looking for.
